For practice with MathWorks tools, including Live scripts, courseware, and MATLAB Copilot, access workshop materials by following the instructions below. You will find three Live script “worksheets” in a GitHub repository. You very likely will not have time to explore and complete all three during the practice session. Review the concepts each worksheet covers by first opening the `Overview.mlx` file. Then, decide which topics are most relevant to you, open a worksheet, and follow the instructions listed therein.

## Access the Practice Session Worksheets:

1. Click the **Open in MATLAB Online** button above.

2. Login to MATLAB Online if prompted  
   a. To access a MATLAB Online trial license, go to: [MathWorks License Center](https://www.mathworks.com/licensecenter/classroom/4962050/)

4.	Double click `Overview.mlx`. Read the brief description of what each of the three worksheets covers and then click the hyperlink to that worksheet to open it. You do [b][u]not[/u][/b] have to start with Worksheet1!

4. Follow the instructions in each exercise on the worksheet. If you get stuck on a section, it is okay (and even encouraged) to ask for help or skip it until later.

5. Does anyone at your table want to start on the same worksheet as you? Feel free to discuss with them as you work your way through examples and exercises!
